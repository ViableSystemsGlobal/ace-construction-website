# Deployment Instructions for Hostinger

## Method 1: Upload via File Manager (Recommended)

   - Navigate to your domain's public_html folder
   - Upload ace-construction.zip
   - Extract the zip file
   - Delete the zip file

3. **Set up Node.js (if not already done):**
   - In Hostinger control panel, go to "Advanced" â†’ "Node.js"
   - Create a new Node.js app
   - Set Node.js version to 18 or higher
   - Set startup file to: server.js or app.js (Hostinger will guide you)

4. **Install dependencies:**

## Method 2: FTP Upload

1. **Use an FTP client (FileZilla, etc.):**

   - Username: your FTP username
   - Password: your FTP password

2. **Upload all files from the 'deploy' folder to public_html**

## Important Notes:

- The uploads folder will store user-uploaded images
- Make sure the uploads folder has write permissions (755)
